# Just working through the Laith Academy tutorial on React Typescript since I'm a bit rusty and came across some challenges in my
fullstack MERN app with GraphQL when writing it out in React Typescript. I want to develop a better understanding to solve the problems I experienced
and to write more readable and performant code with React Typescript.
